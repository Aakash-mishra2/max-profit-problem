# Max Profit Problem

A simple web application to solve the **Max Profit Problem** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project is designed to run locally using the Live Server extension for a seamless development and testing experience.

##Problem statement
Mr. X owns a large strip of land in Mars Land. For the purposes of this problem assume that he has infinite land capacity. On each parcel of he can choose to develop it as per his wishes. He can build either Theatres, Pubs or Commercial Park. Commercial Park houses 6 Commercial Spaces and 8 Screen Theatres.
• A Theatre takes 5 units of time to build and covers 2x1 parcel of land.
• A Pub takes 4 units of time to develop and covers 1x1 parcel of land.
• A Commercial Park takes 10 units of time to build and covers 3x1 parcel
of land.
Each period of time that a building is operational it earns him money.
Establishment Earning
Theatre $1500
Pub $1000
Commercial Park $3000
He cannot have two properties being developed in parallel in one unit of time.
• After n units of time where n is the input, he earns money based on which
properties have been developed.
• The output should be T for Theatre followed by number developed, P for
Pub followed by number developed and C for Commercial Park followed
by number developed.
Challenge
• Come up with the right mix of properties based on the period of time given as
input.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:


## Features

- **Input Interface**: Accepts an array of integers representing heights.
- **Visualization**: Displays the height representation in a graphical format.
- **Solution Logic**: Implements the algorithm to calculate the maximum amount of water that can be trapped.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on different screen sizes.

## Requirements

- **Live Server Extension**: This application requires the Live Server extension in your code editor (e.g., VS Code) to run locally.
